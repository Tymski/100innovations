# 100 Innovations

100 innovations is a display of latest one hundred student projects of Adam Mickiewicz University in Pozna≈Ñ for 100 anniversary.

Project was created on Innovathon!

I focused on simplicity: Short code that is functional.
I learned about accessibility: I added a language attribute for readers.
Flexible styling: style changes, when page is resized to small.
This idea is scalable!: I could very quickly create sites for hackathons all over the place.
A place to explore: After adding carefully selected projects from students, visiting this site can be a great learning experience.
